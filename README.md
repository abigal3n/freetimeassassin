Do you have time but dont know what to do with it?
Well never fear, FreeTimeAssassin is here to take care of it for you

With this program you can create and delete tasks which you add to different categories to help you organize those tasks

Once tasks are created you can then ask FreeTimeAssassin to display all of your tasks, display tasks of a category of your choosing, or even choose a task for you based on how much time you have to spend

That way, instead of wasting precious time going back and forth as to what to work on, you can just let this program do the choosing and spend that time wisely
